                <h6>Plugins and Protocols</h6>
                <p>
                    Squadbot has a set of APIs that have been made with simplicity in mind; they are high level enough to be easy to use, but not such that they lack features. 
                    Even with entry level knowledge of NodeJS, powerful plugins can be written to help you and whoever else is using Squadbot, in professional and informal environments. 
                    Anyone with more 'Noding' experience can even develop their own protocols, making Squadbot <strong>100% extensible and accessible</strong>. 
                    <!-- Know of a chat client no one's thought to write a protocol for? 
                    Write it, and empower everyone with your work! 
                    Got a private group chat with your friends or collegues? 
                    Write some personalised plugins that do anything, from spouting pointless inside jokes to helping get jobs done. -->

                <h6>SPM: Squadbot Package Manager</h6>
                <p>
                    Squadbot has his very own NPM like package manager, making it a piece of cake for anyone to install and implement community developed plugins and protocols in a single command. 
                    This allows anyone to show off their hard work, and let others prosper from it. 
                    Alternatively, show off your social circle's <em>hilarious</em> aforementioned inside jokes... 
                    <!-- This aside, we want to build up a friendly squad of developers, keen to take Squadbot to places none of us had ever imagined. 
                    For a better insight into this vision, check out our main <a href="https://github.com/ABitOfSquad/squadbot/" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a>.</p> -->

                <p>
                    We want Squadbot to be a team effort. 
                    That's why he's open source and open minded (a fancy way of saying how simple writing plugins for him is). 
                    We want to see as much Squadbot activity as possible. 
                    Make sure to send us your plugins and protocols and we'll review and add them to our website and SPM for everyone to enjoy!
